# Customer-Churning-Prediction
Predicting which retail customers are likely to stop shopping at the store.

What customers are likely to churn? What customers should we target?
What are their common features?
Which classification model performs the best?
What if we redefine the churn event to a multiclass problem, eg. no interaction/visit/transaction?


# Problem Statement
If customers that are likely to stop shopping at this retail store are identified; this is crucial for minimizing their churn and optimize retention strategies. 

* In the context of this project, churn is when a customer completely stops to buy the products. For that purpose, any one who is displaying leading traits is considered likely to churn
  
* According to Bloom intelligence, a churn rate between 5 to 7 percent is considered acceptable. Something less than 5 is great but over 7 is a concern. 

Churining can happen due to all sorts of reasons. This project aims to identify which (if there is) is the reason for churing. Is it one of the following? or any other? 
* unsatisfactory services
* competing products
* changing customer needs
* lack of engagement

The overall mission of this project is to not only help in retaining valuable customers by addressing customer satisfaction, but also enhance overall business profitability. 

# Dataset
The data set belongs to a leading online E-Commerce company. An online retail (E commerce) company wants to know the customers who are going to churn, so accordingly they can approach customer to offer some promos.

# Data Preparation

Clean data (missing values, outliers, inconsistencies)

Perform EDA using to understand distribution, correlations, and patters
(example of KPIs to identify: declining purchase frequency, reduced average spending, average purchase frequency overtime, customer support interaction,  or shifts in shopping preferences,)


Create a dashboard for Performance metrics in Tableau

# Feature Engineering

Identifying necessary feature transformation (scaling numerical features, econding categorical variables, deriving new features from existing ones)

# Model Selection and Training
Choose appropriate Model and Explain the rationale

Train the model

Choose the metrics to be use

# Model Evaluation 
Evaluate the model using appropriate metrics and fine tuning

# Model Interpretation 
Interprate the model results using Feature Importance Analysis

Business Conclusion
[By analysing the KPIs, the business can target at risk customers with personalized offers, loyalty incentives, or tailored strategies aimed at increasing engagement and loyalty]

# Model Deployment
Deploy the moel into production and develop a user interface

# Monitoring 
Plan strategies to implement to ensure the model remails accurate and reliable over time

# Presentation
Summarize the entire proces including findings, insights, and recommendations from the project in the presentation- preferably a video presentation
